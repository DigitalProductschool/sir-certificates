# Welcome to Remix!

-   ðŸ“– [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

1. Create an empty postgreSQL database.
2. Copy `.env.template` and rename it to `.env`.
3. Adjust `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to match you settings.
4. Adjust the `SEED_ADMIN_*` settings for your admin user.


Install dependencies:

```shellscript
npm run install
```

> If npm install produces a node-gyp error while installing the canvas dependency, try the `--build-from-source` option and install the dependencies first
> https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas?tab=readme-ov-file#compiling


Run database migrations:

```shellscript
npx prisma db push
```

Install fonts:
We've added Montserrat (open font) as an example for now. Custom fonts can be installed to `/storage/fonts`. 

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

### Automatic deployments

The repo is set up for automatic deployments to a Dokku host.

When pushing changes to `main`, they will be automatically deployed.

When opening a Pull Request from a different branch, a preview deployment will be automatically set up. The preview deployment will run the code from the current branch on a different URL.

Caveats:

-   preview deployments currently interact with the production database, so be careful
- 	storage: `dokku storage:ensure-directory --chown root [app]`, `dokku storage:mount [app] host-path:container-path`, `dokku ps:restart app-name`

Server disk clean-up:

- See available disk space `df -h`
- See docker disk usage `docker system df`
- Reclaim space from docker `docker system prune` (-a / -f)

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

-   `build/server`
-   `build/client`

## Styling

We use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [ShadCn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).

The UI components are located in `/app/components/ui`.

To add a UI component, run `npx shadcn-ui@0.8.0 add dialog` (we're currently on version 0.8.0)

See the Remix.run and [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information on how to use custom css.
