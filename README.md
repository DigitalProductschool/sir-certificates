# Welcome to Remix!

## Development

Create an empty postgreSQL database. \
Copy `.env.template` and rename it to `.env`. \
Adjust `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to match you settings.

Install dependencies:

```shellscript
npm run install
```

> If npm install produces a node-gyp error while installing the canvas dependency, try the `--build-from-source` option and install the dependencies first
> https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas?tab=readme-ov-file#compiling


Run database migrations:

```shellscript
npx prisma db push
```

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

### Automatic deployments

The repo is set up for automatic deployments to a Dokku host.

When pushing changes to `main`, they will be automatically deployed.

When opening a Pull Request from a different branch, a preview deployment will be automatically set up. The preview deployment will run the code from the current branch on a different URL.

Caveats:

-   preview deployments currently interact with the production database, so be careful

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

-   `build/server`
-   `build/client`

## Styling

We use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [ShadCn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).

The UI components are located in `/app/components/ui`.

To add a UI component, run `npx shadcn-ui@0.8.0 add dialog` (we're currently on version 0.8.0)

See the Remix.run and [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information on how to use custom css.
