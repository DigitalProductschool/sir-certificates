# Welcome to Remix!

- ðŸ“– [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

Create an empty postgreSQL database. \
Copy `.env.template` and rename it to `.env`. \
Adjust `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to match you settings.

Install dependencies:

```shellscript
npm run install
```

Run database migrations:

```shellscript
npx prisma db push
```

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

### Automatic deployments


The repo is set up for automatic deployments to a Dokku host.

When pushing changes to `main`, they will be automatically deployed.

When opening a Pull Request from a different branch, a preview deployment will be automatically set up. The preview deployment will run the code from the current branch on a different URL.

Caveats:

- preview deployments currently interact with the production database, so be careful



### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever css framework you prefer. See the [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.
