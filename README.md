# Welcome to Remix!

## Development

Create an empty postgreSQL database. \
Copy `.env.template` and rename it to `.env`. \
Adjust `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to match you settings.

Install dependencies:

```shellscript
npm run install
```

Run database migrations:

```shellscript
npx prisma db push
```

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever css framework you prefer. See the [Vite docs on css](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.
